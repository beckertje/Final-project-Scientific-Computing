# Final-project-Scientific-Computing
Solving the 1-Dimensional Schr√∂dinger Equation numerically on a Grid

Main program is found in "main". All other modules are also added in main branch of the repo.
4 extra files are added: a pdf of the flow chart, a pdf of the variable declarations 
and 2 images showing the results of the shooting algorithm for the two potentials included:
the infinite well and the infinite Gaussian (change commented line in main to change between potentials)
